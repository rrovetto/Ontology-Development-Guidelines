## Metadata
- Metadata is data about data. But it is often relative. One need to understand the distinction expessed by th difference between the object and the meta langauge. E.g., an ontology may model some ontology itself, in which case the constructs (e.g., classes) in the ontolgy would otherwise be metadata in another ontology about some subject matter. 
- Distinguish between the construct (or symbol-structure) being created in the ontolgy (e.g., an OWL Class, OWL Object Property) and any lexical label (a display label) assigned to the construct.
  - Assert a metadata annotation construct to document the purpose or description of the construct itself.
  - Assert a metadata annotation construct to document the definition of the associated natural language label.

- External metadata annotation elements for things like definitions and labels, include elements from specific groups, organizations or projects, e.g., rdfs:label, dc:description, owl:comment. These can be used in an ontology. 
- You can also create your own metadata annotations. For example, to more narrowly focus on, say, a lexical definition, you may create a annotatation such as 'lexical definition'.
