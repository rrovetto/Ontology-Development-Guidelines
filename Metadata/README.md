## Metadata
- Metadata is data about data. But what is metadata is often relative. One needs to understand the difference between **the object and the meta langauge**. E.g., an ontology may model some ontology itself, in which case the constructs (e.g., classes) in the ontolgy would otherwise be metadata in another ontology about some subject matter.
- Distinguish between the **construct** (or **symbol-structure**) being created in the ontolgy (e.g., an OWL Class, OWL Object Property) and any **lexical label** (e.g., a display label) assigned to the construct. The labels are also symbol-structures / constructs (because they are created during the ontology development process).

- Assert a metadata annotation construct to document the purpose or description of the construct itself.
- Assert a metadata annotation construct to document the definition of any associated natural language label.

- External metadata annotation elements for things like definitions and labels, include elements from specific groups, organizations or projects, e.g., rdfs:label, dc:description, owl:comment. These can be used in an ontology. 
- You can also create your own metadata annotations. For example, to more narrowly focus on, say, a lexical definition, you may create a annotatation such as 'lexical definition'. 

- In other words, "free text descriptions. Often a ‘human-friendly text’ description is provided to further clarify design intentions for the entity and improve search." ([source](https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/what-is-a-knowledge-graph/))
