## Background - Preliminaries of Ontology Development: Some Conceptual and Ontological Distinctions 

Some basic distinctions made in modeling (conceptual, ontological, semantic, linguistic, etc.), which are partially drawn from abstract and philosophical inquiry, are:

### Semantic & Terminological Systems
The following are some semantic systems (or resources), using the descriptions from [this presentation on Slideshare, slide 5](https://www.slideshare.net/skhan/ontology-dev?qid=8e6605c2-e7c7-4e76-b5d3-1d817b9e299b&v=&b=&from_search=4). CAVEAT: there are different descriptions of these systems. E.g., some do not consider ontologies to be controlled vocabularies. These semantic/terminological systems are sometimes called 'knolwedge organization systems' (however from an analytical perspective that name is problematic because it is unclear if knowledge or other things are being organized).

- **Controlled Vocabulary**
- **Classification** = a controlled vocabulary whose terps are grouped
- **Taxonomy** = a controlled vocabulary with some hierarchical structure
- **Thesaurus** = a controlled vocabulary with term relations
- **Ontology** = a controlled vocabulary with semantic relations, constraints, axioms and rules
- **Knowledge base** = an ontology + instances of the classes in the ontology

### WHat are Semantic Systems Used for?
- to index, tag, semantically annotate, and categorize content (e.g. documents, text, data, and other resources) in order to facilitate their discovery and retrieval 
- to represent things and knowledge in a machine-readable manner using the constructs or terms in the respective system

### The Generic vs. The Specific

The concept of the generic, the general, the universal, etc. is distinguished from that of the specific, the indvidiual, the particular, etc. 
Historically this is partially a reflection of human philosophical inquiry into attribute-agreement, or how things can be similar, how the seem to have the same attributes, characteristics, etc. 

This is basic distinction is exemplified by some more specific ones such as:

* category - instance
* class - member
* set - element


### Characteristics - Possessors of characterstics

This is the distinction between a property, feature, attribute, quality (or characteristic) and something that is said to possess, have or bear it, i.e., a property-bearer.
