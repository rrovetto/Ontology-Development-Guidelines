## Domain Demarcation / Scoping the Universe of Discourse 
- How to demarcate or scope the target domain/topic/set-of-concepts
- How do we demarcate the target domain of interest?
## Considerations
- There are many ways to scope, demarcate, prescribe boundaries of the target domain of interest. How to do so is an open question. Most, if not all, things are interconnected in some way. 
- What may appear to be presented as a discipline, domain, or topic, may be overlapping with others so presented. Their boundaries may be arbitrary or fuzzy. Apparenty crisp boundaries may be a matter of convenience.
## Terminology
- That which is being modeled in an ontology can go by various names: universe of discourse, domain of interest, domain of discourse, domain, subject, topic area, etc.
- A set of concepts can also be the target domain.
