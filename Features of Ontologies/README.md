## Features of Ontologies

The following are a set of minimum feartures of ontologies. 

* Subject-matter coverage
* Subject-matter capture 
* Revisability
* Consistency
* Coherence
* Expressive knowledge representation language formalism
  - Using the most expressive formalism available should help achieve a high degree of subject-matter capture, i.e. a high degree of knowledge capture. It should afford representing knowledge in the target domain of interest. However, there may presently be fewer tools to support it (if you're a software developer, then create them!). Tradeoffs are often necessary between expressivity and computability. Beginning with formal analysis, e.g., pen to paper using first and higher order logics may provide a picture of how to capture subject-matter knolwedge in a highly expressive manner before selecting a formalism. 

NOTE: Consideer the Close-world vs. Open-world assumption. Whether you opt for one or the other (or another option?) may depend on the project.
