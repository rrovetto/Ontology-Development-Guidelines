## Features of Ontologies

The following are a set of minimum feartures of ontologies. Each feature can be evaluated.

* **Subject-matter coverage** - the extent to which an ontology 
* **Subject-matter capture** 
* **Revisability** - an ontology being mutable, modifiable, editable, etc. It can be updated when the target subject-matter changes, when new data is acquired, when mistakes are found in data, domain knowledge, the model, etc.
* **Consistency**
*   Logical Consistency - the logical formalizations in the ontology do not admit of contradictions. the ontology is logically consistent. The ontology's axioms, constraints, restrictions do not admit of contradictions. (assuming a background logic where contradictions are not desired)
*   Semantic or non-logical Consistency - the natural-language definitions and any other readable notes or annotations do not express things that are contradictory, e.g., multiple contradictory definitions of a single category term.   
* **Coherence** - the informal and formal semantics are expressed in a manner that makes sense given knowledge of the target subject-matter. the ontology model is reasonably, ratonally developed. The content is comprehensible.
* **Expressive knowledge representation language formalism**
  - Using the most expressive formalism available should help achieve a high degree of subject-matter capture, i.e. a high degree of knowledge capture. It should afford representing knowledge in the target domain of interest. However, there may be fewer tools to support it (if you're a software developer, then create them!). 
NOTE: Tradeoffs are often necessary between expressivity and computability. Beginning with formal analysis, e.g., pen to paper using first and higher order logics may provide a picture of how to capture subject-matter knolwedge in a highly expressive manner before selecting a formalism. 
NOTE: the desired degree of expressivity will vary based on the project (purpose, goals, desired functionalities, funding, etc.)

NOTE: Consideer the Close-world vs. Open-world assumption. Whether you opt for one or the other (or another option?) may depend on the project.
