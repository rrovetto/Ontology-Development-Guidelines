## Terminology Development Guidelines
- After reviewing the target subject-matter, identify jargon as well as category terms and concepts essential to, specific/unique to, or relevant for talking about and describing the target subject-matter
- What are words and phrases unique to, or with specific meanings in, the target subject-matter? What are category terms that desribe the subject? What are relational terms, describing relationships in the subject-matter?
- List these terms and concepts (create terms for the concepts expressed (but not explicitly written) in the corpus material.
- Identify terms about individual things, actual things (not categories), or particular things. 
- List those terms. 
- Keep the fundamental distinction of category vs. instance in mind.
