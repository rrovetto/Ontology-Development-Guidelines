## About Semantic/Ontology/Terminology Harmonization, Mappings or what I will call Semantic Synchronization 

This section discusses mapping and alignment activities between two ontologies (or other knowledge organization systems / semantic systems, e.g., controlled vocabularies, taxonomies), or  what is sometimes more broadly called semantic harmonization. Each however, has been more quantiatively defined in the ontology engineering literature.

This is about activities & output for exploring terminological synchronization, semantic harmonization, crosswalks and mappings between a set of given systems or a set of terms. The described method is a manual (not automated) approach. A goal is to provide a manual and generic synchronization/harmonization process.

Overarching questions:
- What are the similarities and differences between two given knowledge organization systems / semantic systems / ... ('terminologies' for short)?
- Can a given set of terminologies, or set (or pair) of terms from distinct vocabularies, be mapped, synchonized or harmonized?
- What is synchronization and harmonization? 
- What are the ethical aspeects?
- To what degree are a given set of terminologies, or set of term, mapped?
 - What type of mappings? (e.g., string, syntax, semantics, assumptions, leaf-node only, degree of abstraction/subclassificaiton, etc.)
