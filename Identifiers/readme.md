## Guidelines for developing Identifiers

Depending on the situation, you may assign either so-called...

(a) **opaque or semantically-neutral identifiers** (which do not express meaning). These include identifiers composed of strings of (alpha)numeric characters that are not intended to convey any meaning, such as random-numbered identifier, or a sequentially-numbered identifier. UUIDs or GUIDs are type of opaque identifiers.
or

(b) **readiable identifiers**. These includes human-readible character strings, e.g., "Motor vehcile" or "motor-vehicle"
...for all constructs (e.g., classes) in the ontology.

- Select a type and format for identifiers, e.g., random-generated alphanumeric, sequential numeric, etc.
