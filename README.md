# Ontology Development Guidelines
This repository contains descriptions that succinctly explain how to develop an ontology, and some methodological aspects for doing so. Guidelines and practices are offerred. Below is a **generic ontology development methodology**. CAVEAT: this is based on my experience and studies and is thereby biased in that respect. The reader should be aware that there areother methods, both automated and manual means to develop an ontology.

## Stages of Ontology Development
A generic ontology development methodology includes the following activities: identifying and scoping your topic area; corpus or domain material research; listing or creating a defined set of terms, a taxonomy and classificaiton system; and both applications of and data for that system. It is **iterative** and **non-linear**: some phases of the development process may be performed concurrently and revisited.

### 1. Purpose & Subject matter 
- Identify purpose(s) or function(s) for the ontology. _What is it for?_
- Identify what subject/domain or set of concepts you wish to ontologically model.

### 2. Subject-matter Research
- Research the target subject or domain corpora

### 3. Use-cases
- Identify use-cases for the ontology. _Where may it be applied? What systems may benefit from it? What are situations in which it could be used?_

### 4. Scope
- Identify the boundaries of the university of discourse (or target subject/domain) that the ontology(s) will represent.

### 5. Requirements & Specification Details
- Identify what will be required to realize the purpose and apply to the use-cases. 
- State specification details: 
	- What natural language? 
	- What computable lanuage (knowlede representation and reasoning language / implementation langauges)? 
	- Stylistic conventions, e.g., naming conventions for terms/labels, etc.  
	- Identify or create competency questions: queries that the ontology (and datasets) can be asked computationally.
- Select, Acquire or Develop resources and tools, e.g., ontology editor software, knowledge representation languages, 
- Corpora (research documents, domain knowledge), data sources, contibutors, partners, subject-matter experts, etc.

### 6. Research & Conceptual Analysis of the Subject/domain
- Examine the target subject matter. Try to identify essential concepts, themes, challenges, etc. Gain a big-picture understanding.

### 7. List...
- Identify & list specific things in the universe of discourse you want the ontology to represent.
- Identify & list concepts and terms needed to describe the things in universe of discourse. 
- Create concepts and terms where needed.

### 8. Definitions
- Identify the intended meaning for each of the list of things, concepts and terms.
	- You may begin with some intended meaning or concept, and the form a term that most clearly expresses it. 
- Research definitions (of key terms) from corpus material: dictionaries, academia, journal publicaitons, subject-matter experts, etc.
- Identify undefined (primitive) terms. 
- Write definitions in natural-language that most closely expresses that intended meaning.
- For all primitive terms, state they are undefined, but also provide a clarifying note to provide the user with some sense of meaning. 

### 9. Structure
- In this process, identify how the things or terms denoting them are related (if at all). Distinguish between relationships between the word (term) and what it denotes. E.g., dogs have four legs. vs. the word 'dog' means [...].
- Create or select terms for how they are related (i.e., for the relationships between them).
- Define these relational terms.
- Use abstract distinctions and structuring relations, e.g., category vs. instance, class vs. member, class and subclass, broader & narrower, etc. 

### 10. Formalize
- Develop semi-formal or formal logical definitions.
	- You may translate the intended meaning or natural language definitions into, e.g., first-order logic for precision. 
- Chose or create a formalism that is computable. 
- Translate the natural language meanings into the chosen formal language, or use your chosen ontology editor tool’s language.
- Formal definitions may use the labels to better foster automation.
