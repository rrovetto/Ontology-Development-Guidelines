# Catalog of 'ontology' definitions
- A living catalog of definitions of 'ontology' and variations of the term such as 'formal ontology', 'domain ontology', etc., in computational and interdisicplinary contexts. Due to the interdisicplinary context, philosophical ontology is included.
  - _Count_: 91 definitions of 'ontology' (Jan 2022), 130 definitions (Jan 2023). 
  - Below is a _sample_ of the catalog.

## Development Methodology
- Descriptions/definitions are manually added to the spreadsheet document as I find them when reading reference material. Originally began during my 2009 studies in ontology.
  - Source material includes research articles, websites, reports, books, presentation documents in conferences/workshops, etc.
  - Authors, reference/source documents, website URLs, and other information is added to the catalog. 
- Historical and popular definitions are added. 
- Definitions that I believe are particularly succinct or informative are added.
- For all definitions, I attempt to find the original source. E.g., If definitions are presented as quotes in a given reference document, then I research to find the source document of that quote. This includes corresponding authors to inquire.
This is therefore a time-consuming and painstaking task.
