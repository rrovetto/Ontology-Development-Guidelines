# Catalog of 'ontology' (and similar terms) definitions
This is a living catalog of definitions of 'ontology' (as well as similar and variations of the term) in computational and interdisicplinary contexts (primiarly data and modeling). Due to the interdisicplinary context, philosophical ontology is included, but for brevity, limited to a few definitions.
  - _Count_: 91 definitions of 'ontology' (Jan 2022), 130 definitions (Jan 2023). 
  - Below is a sample of the catalog.
  - _Includes definitions for these terms:_ ontology, ontologies, meta-ontology, philosophical ontology, computational ontology, formal ontology, information ontology, upper ontology, general ontology, generic ontology, foundational ontology, upper model, top-level ontology, top ontology, base ontology, core ontology, mid-level ontology, reference ontology, domain ontology, method ontology, task ontology, application ontology, conceptual (data) model, meta-model, semantic (data) model, knowledge graph

## Support - How you can help
- As unfunded work in the authors own time, [donations are welcome (visit this webpage)](https://gogetfunding.com/knowledge-organization-services-ontology-terminology-metadata-concept-analysis/). 
## Transition to Open-access
- Due to the large number of person hours spent on this work without funding and as a job-seeker, if sufficient donations/purchases are made, the catalog will be made open.

## Development Methodology
- Descriptions/definitions are manually added to the spreadsheet document as I find them when reading reference material. Originally began during my 2009 studies in ontology.
  - Source material includes research articles, websites, reports, books, presentation documents in conferences/workshops, etc.
  - Authors, reference/source documents, website URLs, and other information is added to the catalog. 
- Historical and popular definitions are added. 
- Definitions that I believe are particularly succinct or informative are added.
- For all definitions, I attempt to find the original source. E.g., If definitions are presented as quotes in a given reference document, then I research to find the source document of that quote. This includes corresponding authors to inquire.
This is therefore a time-consuming and painstaking task.
