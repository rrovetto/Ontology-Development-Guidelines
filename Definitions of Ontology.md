# Catalog of 'ontology' definitions
## About
[A living catalog of definitions of 'ontology' and cognates can be viewed at this website link](https://tinyurl.com/mtae3d8s). 
## Support & Status
If you find value in my work, please [support/donate here](https://gogetfunding.com/knowledge-organization-services-ontology-terminology-metadata-concept-analysis/). As a presently unfunded project, financial support is needed to sustain development.
