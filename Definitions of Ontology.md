## Contribute
[Contact](https://ontospace.wordpress.com/contact) if you have definitions (and their sources). I will review, verify, and compare for duplicates in the catalog. 

## Development Methodology
- Descriptions/definitions are manually added to the spreadsheet document as I find them when reading reference material. 
  - Source material includes research articles, websites, reports, books, presentation documents in conferences/workshops, etc. 
- Historical and popular definitions are added. Definitions that I believe are particularly succinct or informative are especially added.
- For all definitions, I attempt to find the original source. E.g., If definitions are presented as quotes in a given reference document, then I research to find the source document of that quote. This includes corresponding authors to inquire.
- Authors, reference/source documents, website URLs, and other information is added to the spreadsheet catalog.
This is therefore a time-consuming and painstaking task.
