# Truths about Ontology Development - An eye on ethics for you and the community

## Be innovative and creative.
### 1. You can create your own ontology, regardless of the degree of abstraction or specificity or application
- You can create your own subject-specific ontology (sometimes called: domain ontology, application ontology, lower-level ontology, etc.)
- You can create your own generic ontology (also called: general ontology, foundational ontology, base ontology, upper-level ontology, top-level ontology, core ontology, etc.)

### 2. You do not have to reuse existing ontologies.
- Anyone that says you must (or is pushy about it), is very likely trying to get you to use theirs (i.e. they probably have some vested interest to get more users).
- Do not encourage abusive or unfair business tactics, or attempts to monopolize

## Be informed, be aware, and be responsible. (Transparency & Ethics)
### 3. If you're considering using an existing ontology, _be informed_ about what you are committing to
An ontology may commit to other ontologies by importing them, or may commit to a specific theory, or to specific models of the world or a target domain, or to philosophical worldviews, etc. So...
- Be aware of all commitments an ontology makes, at all degrees of abstraction
- Be aware of the assumptions, worldviews, and ontological commitments it makes. (Read documentation, look at the ontology at all levels of abstraction, at its axioms, imports, etc.)
- Be aware of any imported ontologies or taxonomies the candidate ontology commits to or uses.
(Be aware of other ontologies or semantic resources you may be committing to by using the candidate ontology.)

### 4. You have a right to understand what an ontology say about the world in general, or about your subject, discipline, or expertise.
- Does an ontology allow the concepts you want to include or model?
- Will a more abstract, generic or upper-level ontology mischaracterize or miscategorize your domain concepts? 
- Will an ontology exclude your domain concepts? 
- Do not believe the "black box" saying that an ontology should be hidden from users or end-users. Anyone that tries to convince you of this is probably trying to push their ontology on you.
- Being informed and having information is always better than not.

### 5. Ontologies may not be the solution.
- There are other technologies and methods to achieve the same purported results

### 6. You do not need an generic/upper/top-level/foundational ontology
- There are other tech and methods to achieve the same results

## Common Sense and Ethics - some fallacious or invalid arguments

### 7. Popularity does not mean quality. And standardization does not mean quality.
- The amount of users does not mean an ontology is good, or useful.
- These things are invalid arguments that are used to convince you to use their product. Some have gained popularity or standardization by relying on ignorance of others and by using other unethical practices.

### 8. Ontology development and engineering is still an immature field, with limited quantitative evidence for its utility, and even less tools to harness the most expressive forms of ontologies.
- Do not believe the hype (just like with anything).
