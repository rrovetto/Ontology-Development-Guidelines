# Truths about Ontology Development & Use
## An eye on ethics for you and the community

Some of the following may be obvious to some readers, but explicitly stating them is necessary to (i) express it for posterity, for the student, and for the non-specialist so that they (ii) are informed and so that (iii) misinformation is mitigated.

## Problems & Limitations
- Be aware of the [problems and limitations of top-level ontologies and their development](https://github.com/rrovetto/How-To-Build-a-Top-level-Ontology/tree/main/Problems%20with%20Top-level%20Ontologies)

## Be innovative and creative
### 1. You can create your own top-level ontology, at any degree of abstraction, specificity, generality, or application
- _You can create your own topic-specific ontology_ (also called: domain ontology, domain-specific ontology, application ontology, lower-level ontology, etc.)
- _You can create your own highly generic ontology_ (also called: general/generic ontology, foundational ontology, base ontology, upper-level ontology, top-level ontology, core ontology, etc.)
  - Some developers may resist this fact because some existing ontologies are the result of years of work, collaboratively or otherwise. Having multiple contributors may aid in some aspect of development and in quality control, but it is no guarantee of these things and it is not guarantee of the utility of the ontology.
- You can create one for your more-specific domain ontology. You do not need to use an existing top-level ontology, in part because it may not be the correct abstract model for your domain ontology, e.g., it may make commitments or ideological assumptions you disagree with. 

### 2. You do not have to reuse existing ontologies.
- Anyone that says you must (or is pushy about it), is very likely trying to get you to use or purchase theirs.
- Do not tolerate, and do not encourage unfair tactics, political abuse, or attempts to monopolize. 

## Be informed, be aware, and be responsible. (Transparency & Ethics)
### 3. If you're considering using an existing ontology, _be informed_ about what you are committing to
An ontology may commit to other ontologies by importing them, or may commit to a specific theory, or to specific models of the world or a target domain, or to philosophical worldviews, etc. So...
- Be aware of all commitments an ontology makes, at all degrees of abstraction
- Be aware of the assumptions, worldviews, and ontological commitments it makes. (Read documentation, look at the ontology at all levels of abstraction, at its axioms, imports, etc.)
- Be aware of any imported ontologies or taxonomies the candidate ontology commits to or uses.
(Be aware of other ontologies or semantic resources you may be committing to by using the candidate ontology.)

### 4. You have a right to understand what an ontology says about your subject, discipline, data, expertise, or about the world if anything.
- Does an ontology allow the concepts/categories/terms you want to include or model? Will an ontology exclude your domain concepts? 
- Can you accurate model/represent or semantically annotate your data and your domain concepts/terms with the candidate ontology? 
- Will a more abstract, generic or upper-level ontology mischaracterize or miscategorize your domain concepts? 
- Do not believe the "black box" saying that an ontology should be hidden from users or end-users. Anyone that tries to convince you of this is probably trying to push their ontology on you.
- Being informed, even of the seemingly mundande or ineffectual detials, is always better than not.

### 5. You do not need an generic/upper/top-level/foundational ontology
- There are other technologies and methods to achieve the same results.
- Some developers may resist this fact, but it is important to put ones bias for their vested interst (or lifes work) aside, and be objective, fair and truthful. Stating it explicitly, even if obvious, is essential for the sake of communicating those facts; it will help to prevent (intentional or unintentional) misinformation. It will help inform poterity.

## Some Facts - Common Sense and Ethical Aspects

### 6. Ontologies may not be the solution.
- There are other technologies and methods to achieve the same purported results

### 7. Ontology development and engineering (and related semantic modeling approaches, and knowledge-based approaches) is a relatively immature topic, with limited quantitative evidence for its utility, and even less tools to harness the most robust (or heavyweight) forms of ontologies and the most expressive ontology (or knowledge representation) formal languages.
- This may be a contentious point for some, but bottom line is...
- **Do not blindly believe the hype** (just like with anything). Just like with any other activity, tehnology, or product, we must admit such facts, and not exaggerate the benefits or state of ontology despite being vested in the topic

### 8. Popularity does not mean quality. And standardization does not mean quality, does not mean it will work, or is desired for your project.
- The amount of users an ontology (or ontology project) has does **not** mean an ontology is good, or useful.
- Presence in an (inter)national standards organization, e.g., having a standard document of an ontology, does **not** mean the ontology is good quality, useful, correct, etc. Some have entered into standards through political abuse and other unethical actions (evidence and cases available).
- Like in other disciplines, popularity, and presence in a standards organization, are invalid arguments that are used to convince people to accept the product or technology (e.g., an ontology).
