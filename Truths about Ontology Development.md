# Truths about Ontology Development - An eye on ethics for you and the community

Some of the following facts may be obvious, but explicitly stating them is necessary to express the truths for posterity and for the non-specialist so that they are informed and so that misinformation is mitigated.

## Be innovative and creative.
### 1. You can create your own ontology, regardless of the degree of abstraction or specificity or application
- You can create your own subject-specific ontology (sometimes called: domain ontology, application ontology, lower-level ontology, etc.)
- You can create your own generic ontology (also called: general ontology, foundational ontology, base ontology, upper-level ontology, top-level ontology, core ontology, etc.)
- Developer of upper ontologies may resist this because such existing are often the result of years and work, collaboratively or otherwise. Having others to help--like any project--can certainly help development and quality. However, and nevertheless, if one is educated on the topic and the necessary background concepts, then you can create your own.    
-  
### 2. You do not have to reuse existing ontologies.
- Anyone that says you must (or is pushy about it), is very likely trying to get you to use theirs (i.e. they probably have some vested interest to get more users).
- Do not encourage abusive or unfair business tactics, or attempts to monopolize

## Be informed, be aware, and be responsible. (Transparency & Ethics)
### 3. If you're considering using an existing ontology, _be informed_ about what you are committing to
An ontology may commit to other ontologies by importing them, or may commit to a specific theory, or to specific models of the world or a target domain, or to philosophical worldviews, etc. So...
- Be aware of all commitments an ontology makes, at all degrees of abstraction
- Be aware of the assumptions, worldviews, and ontological commitments it makes. (Read documentation, look at the ontology at all levels of abstraction, at its axioms, imports, etc.)
- Be aware of any imported ontologies or taxonomies the candidate ontology commits to or uses.
(Be aware of other ontologies or semantic resources you may be committing to by using the candidate ontology.)

### 4. You have a right to understand what an ontology says about the world in general, or about your subject, discipline, or expertise.
- Does an ontology allow the concepts you want to include or model?
- Will a more abstract, generic or upper-level ontology mischaracterize or miscategorize your domain concepts? 
- Will an ontology exclude your domain concepts? 
- Do not believe the "black box" saying that an ontology should be hidden from users or end-users. Anyone that tries to convince you of this is probably trying to push their ontology on you.
- Being informed and having information is always better than not.

### 5. Ontologies may not be the solution.
- There are other technologies and methods to achieve the same purported results

### 6. You do not need an generic/upper/top-level/foundational ontology
- There are other technologies and methods to achieve the same results.
- Some upper ontology developers may resist this fact, but it is important to put ones bias for their vested interst or lifes work aside, and be objective and truthful. Stating it explicitly, even if obvious, is needed for the sake of communicating those facts to prevent misinformation and for poterity to be informed.

## Some Facts - Common Sense and Ethical aspects

### 7. Popularity does not mean quality. And standardization does not mean quality.
- The amount of users an ontology (or ontology project) has does **not** mean an ontology is good, or useful.
- Presence in an (inter)national standards organization, e.g., having a standard document of an ontology, does **not** mean the ontology is good quality, useful, correct, etc. Some have entered into standards through political abuse and other unethical actions (evidence and cases available).
- Like in other disciplines, popularity, and presence in a standards organization, are invalid arguments that are used to convince people to accept the product or technology (e.g., an ontology).

### 8. Ontology development and engineering is still a relatively immature topic, with limited quantitative evidence for its utility, and even less tools to harness the most robust (or heavyweight) forms of ontologies and the most expressive ontology (or knowledge representation) formal languages.
- Do not believe the hype (just like with anything).
- Like with any other activity, tehnology, or product we must admit such facts, and not exaggerate the benefits or state of ontology despite being vested in the topic
