# Definitional Guidelines

1) Include at least one natural-language definition or description for each _ontology construct_, i.e., for each _class, individual, relation, property_, etc.

2) Include a computable definition that matches the natural-language definition as closely as possible. 

NOTE: limit the loss of expressivity, as much as possible, during the translation from natural-language definition to computation definition. It can be limited by using a computable formal language that has high expressivity and minimal language bias. And more generally by spending time on conceptual analysis, hand-made first- and second-order logic translation of the n-l def., etc. 

3) Have human-readible annotation notes or metadata tags for each, e.g., labeled as 'Natural-language Definition'
Note: consider degrees and types of definition, e.g., natural-language, semi-formal, formal, first-order logic definition, etc. 

NOTE: there are many types of definitions. For computation, you can follow the rules of your chosen formal langauge (e.g., RDF, OWL, CLIF, etc.).
