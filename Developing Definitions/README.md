# Guidelines for Developing Definitions in Computational Ontologies

1) Include at least one natural-language definition or description for each _ontology construct_, i.e., for each _class, individual, relation, property_, etc.

2) Include a computable definition that matches, as closely as possible, the natural-language definition.

3) Optionally include a tool-independent / implementation-independent formal logical definition (perhaps as a metadata annotation).

**NOTE**: limit the loss of expressivity, as much as possible, during the translation from natural-language definition to computation definition. It can be limited by using a computable formal language that has high expressivity and minimal language bias. And more generally by spending time on conceptual analysis, hand-made first- and second-order logic translation of the n-l def., etc. 

4) Have human-readible metadata annotations or notes for each definition. Example metadata annotation: 'natural-language definition'.

**NOTE**: there are many types of definitions, e.g., ostensive, etc. For computation, you can follow the rules of your chosen formal langauge (e.g., RDF, OWL, CLIF, etc.). 

**NOTE**: one approach to making definitions is a genus-species-differentia form, specifying sub-categories and distinguishing features for each. They resemble a template such as:
CategoryX is-a-kind-of CategoryY that/which Z
